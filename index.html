<h2>About Face</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WIQ5SAufmp4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>‘About Face’ teaches children how to recognise emotions from facial expressions. The app is developed by psychologists at the University of Bristol. It uses realistic computer-generated faces to illustrate the emotions of happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, anger and surprise. Children practice emotion recognition with five activities: recognizing an emotion from one face, recognizing different emotions from two faces, tapping the emotion that corresponds to one face, and matching two faces that express the same emotion, either by choosing between two options, or as part of a memory game.</p>

<p><b>Overall impression?</b><br /> ‘About Face’ is easy to use and highly customizable. You can manipulate a wide variety of features, from what and how many emotions and faces are shown, to background colour and sounds. What particularly stands out is the possibility of fine-tuning the subtleness (or obviousness) of the face expressions, both before the activities and during the activities.</p>

<p><b>Is parental involvement needed/possible?</b><br /> The app is intended to be used with an adult helper. However, children can use the app on their own if they wish. There are no ads or in-app purchases to worry about.</p>

<p><b>Are the emotions/face expressions presented realistic?</b><br /> Having been developed by psychologists, and using realistic computer-generated faces, you can rest assured that both the emotions and the face expressions presented are realistic, and that the match between them is accurate.</p> 

<p><b>How much does it cost?</b><br /> ‘About Face’ is free, with no in-app purchases. Head to the video description for a download link.</p>

<p><b>How can I get 'About Face'?</b><br /> Download 'About Face' for free on your iPad <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/about-face-emotion-recognition/id1067896001?mt=8>from the App Store</a>.

<h2>Kloog 2 - Return to Zugopolis</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zCJEz94CSI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Return to Zugopolis is the sequel of Social Skills for Autism, continuing the story of Kloog, an alien learning social skills. This time, Kloog recruits the help of his new human friends to teach social skills to the other aliens in his planetary system. They all need to learn about friendship, and quite fast – Suctar, a “misunderstood” alien, plans to blast their planets with sloppy gravy meatballs. The only way the quirky aliens can save their planets is by working together.</p>

<p>The children learn social skills applicable to both real life and online environments. These are: how to tell if someone is a friend, how to develop and maintain friendships, and how to stay safe from bullies. The lessons are brought to life by gorgeous animations and explanations delivered by Kloog himself. After each lesson, the child gets a quiz testing their newly-gained knowledge. If they pass the quiz, they get an item that will help Kloog and his friends save their planets.</p>

<p><b>Overall impression?</b><br /> Wow. The first part of this series was great, and the sequel somehow manages to be even better. Alongside the beautiful animations and the great learning content, the developers didn’t shy away from humour, either in the form of wordplay, or funny answers in the quizzes, which sound like exactly the kind of beliefs children and adolescents may hold…</p> 

<p>Furthermore, return to Zugopolis provides children with concrete, actionable steps they can employ in diverse social situations.</p> 

<p>It should be mentioned that at the time of this review, there are some minor errors in the app that you need to be aware of. <a href=https://youtu.be/5zCJEz94CSI>Head to the video description on Youtube</a> to see what these are. It is worth saying that these do not detract from the pure awesomeness of this app.</p>

<p><b>Is parental involvement possible/needed?</b><br /> Return to Zugopolis can be played without an adult – the child only needs to skip some of the tasks. But playing with the help of an adult is clearly the app’s intention, and rightfully so – completing the questions and tasks contained in each lesson enriches both the children’s playing experience and their learning outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Are the social situations presented realistic?</b><br /> The social situations presented are realistic and relevant to children’s daily lives. It is especially great that both the offline and the online environment are discussed, with direct references to current social media platforms and how to stay safe while using them. By delivering the lessons via animations, children actually ‘see’ the situation presented, which enhances their understanding and retention of the social rules discussed.</p> 

<p><b>How much does it cost?</b><br /> Return to Zugopolis is free, with no in-app purchases.</p>

<h2>Let's be Social - Social Skills Development</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DSRy_pkP5g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>'Let’s be Social' helps teach social skills to children and adolescents with developmental delays, such as autism spectrum disorder. It presents the user with 20 short social stories, spanning six sets of social skills: personal interactions, navigating the community, school behaviour, handling change and social relationships.</p> 

<p>After reading or being read each story, the user is prompted to answer a series of questions. These questions test the user’s understanding of the terms used in the social story, and of the appropriateness of the behaviours and emotions depicted in it. After answering all the questions, the user is told the story again, and is rewarded with golden stars.</p>

<p><b>Overall impression?</b><br /> Let’s be Social is a straightforward and easy to use app. You can customise it by adding new skill sets and new social stories, as well as questions testing the understanding of these stories.</p>

<p><b>Is parental involvement possible/needed?</b><br /> Let’s be Social can be used both with and without adult supervision. There are no parental controls though, so you should make sure that the child does not accidentally navigate outside the app. Head over to the video description to see how you can easily prevent this.</p>

<p><b>Are the social situations presented realistic?</b><br /> The social situations presented are appropriate, though simplistic. The stories included in the app cannot be edited by the user in this version. There is a paid version of the app which does allow you to edit the default stories, along with other premium features such as recording yourself reading the stories. If you would like to try out the free version first, you can get around this editing limitation by simply creating a ‘new’ story, in which you copy the default story’s text and edit it as needed.</p>

<p><b>How much does it cost?</b><br /> Let’s be Social is free. The paid version with premium added features costs 10 dollars, and it can be purchased from the App Store, or straight from the free version’s menu. To make sure that your child does not accidentally purchase the paid version from the app’s menu, head over to the video description to learn how you can temporarily block your child from navigating outside the app. </p>
<p><b>How can I get 'Let's be Social'?</b><br /> Download 'Social Skills for Autism' for free on your iPad <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lets-be-social-social-skills/id1140153485?mt=8>from the App Store</a>.

<h2>Social Skills for Autism</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0gK2czFK3Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>By using the story of Kloog, an extraterrestrial that finds himself stranded on Earth, Social Skills for Autism teaches social rules to children and adolescents on the spectrum. In order to rebuild his spaceship, Kloog needs some items that he can only get by interacting with humans. But getting humans to help him requires social skills, and these are something Kloog never heard of on his planet. So he needs to learn these from scratch!</p>

<p>The player helps Kloog learn social rules via “missions”, each targeting a social skill domain: non-verbal communication, conversation skills and what the developers call “think before you talk”, containing lessons on how to disagree in a nice way, what honesty means, and also why social rules are important. After each successful completion of a mission, the player is rewarded with a funny clip of Kloog rebuilding his spaceship.</p>

<p>Rather than listing social rules, Social Skills for Autism also takes the time to explain why certain behaviours are more appropriate than others. It even goes as far as to prompt the player to imagine themselves into the other person’s shoes. The social behaviours learned are further consolidated by tasks that the player can complete with the help on an adult.</p>

<p>Each lesson is followed by a quiz, which puts the player’s newly-gained knowledge to test. Every time the player successfully completes a quiz, Kloog receives a new part to rebuild his spaceship.</p>

<p><b>Overall impression?</b><br /> This app does live up to its name. “Social Skills for Autism” is designed using elements of the Personal & Life Skills Programme, a programme ran in Ireland that equips children and adolescents with high functioning autism and Asperger’s syndrome with foundational social skills.</p> 
<p>However, even those not on the spectrum, and of all ages, can benefit from this app. It is not often that we explicitly think about, discuss and practice social rules. “Social Skills for Autism” provides a fun opportunity to do so.</p>

<p><b>Is parental involvement needed/possible?</b><br /> “Social Skills for Autism” is designed with an adult helper in mind. Although the players can use the app on their own (if they are willing to skip some tasks), the maximum benefit from this app can only be gained with the help of an adult.  This adult can take the lessons and situations presented in this app, and personalize them in order to meet the exact needs of the player.</p> 

<p><b>Are the social situations presented realistic?</b><br />The social situations presented are realistic and appropriate. “Social Skills for Autism” even discusses the use of white lies, and when they might be appropriate. Even the topic of death is touched on. But if you’d prefer not discussing it with your child just yet, head to the video description to see how you can skip that section.</p>

<p><b>How much does it cost?</b><br /> “Social Skills for Autism” is free, with no in-app purchases.

<h2>10 Ways - A Social Skills Game</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CH9wb1m8NP0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

</iframe>
<p>'10 ways' is a Jeopardy-style app that helps children improve their social communication skills.</p>

<p>Under the coaching of an adult, children compete against one another by answering questions and completing tasks related to social situations and social communication. There is also a single player mode for those who’d rather play on their own, or want to practice before they challenge other children.</p>

<p>Despite its competitive format, 10 ways strongly encourages cooperation and group work. There are direct prompts, in the form of questions that require the child to get help from another player. But the most notable feature of this app is the open-ended nature of most questions, and their potential to spark debates between participating children and adults. I believe everyone can take away insights from this app: children and adults alike, regardless of their social communication skills.</p>

<p>'10 ways' makes reference to the 10 types of questions players can get, each challenging their social skills thinking in a different way. The children are required to complete tasks such as inferring the meaning of a phrase from a social context, role-play a social situation, or even draw facial expressions and feelings.</p>

<p>Each game ends with the Social Showdown. The Social Showdown is a special question which serves as revision for the social skills practiced during the game.</p>

<p><b>Overall impression?</b><br /> 10 ways is a beautiful app. With over 400 engaging questions, any child is bound to find some that will make them reflect and gain new social knowledge. Even adults might learn something new.</p>

<p><b>Is parental involvement needed or possible?</b><br /> An adult needs to be involved in the game, in order to determine which of the answers children give are correct. </p>
 
<p><b>Are the social situations presented realistic?</b><br /> Yes. Moreover, the adult involved should feel free to clarify or adapt any of the social situations presented, depending on the children’s needs. The adult should also make sure that the answers children give are realistic.</p>

<p><b>How much does it cost?</b><br /> 10 ways is free, with no in-app purchases. 
</p>

<p><b>How can I get '10 Ways'?</b><br /> Download '10 Ways' for free on your iPad <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/10-ways-a-social-skills-game/id1116372204?mt=8>from the App Store</a>.</p>
