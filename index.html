<p>'10 ways' is a Jeopardy-style app that helps children improve their social communication skills.</p>

<p>Under the coaching of an adult, children compete against one another by answering questions and completing tasks related to social situations and social communication. There is also a single player mode for those who’d rather play on their own, or want to practice before they challenge other children.</p>

<p>Despite its competitive format, 10 ways strongly encourages cooperation and group work. There are direct prompts, in the form of questions that require the child to get help from another player. But the most notable feature of this app is the open-ended nature of most questions, and their potential to spark debates between participating children and adults. I believe everyone can take away insights from this app: children and adults alike, regardless of their social communication skills.</p>

<p>'10 ways' makes reference to the 10 types of questions players can get, each challenging their social skills thinking in a different way. The children are required to complete tasks such as inferring the meaning of a phrase from a social context, role-play a social situation, or even draw facial expressions and feelings.</p>

<p>Each game ends with the Social Showdown. The Social Showdown is a special question which serves as revision for the social skills practiced during the game.</p>

<p><b>Overall impression?</b><br /> 10 ways is a beautiful app. With over 400 engaging questions, any child is bound to find some that will make them reflect and gain new social knowledge. Even adults might learn something new.</p>

<p><b>Is parental involvement needed or possible?</b><br /> An adult needs to be involved in the game, in order to determine which of the answers children give are correct. </p>
 
<p><b>Are the social situations presented realistic?</b><br /> Yes. Moreover, the adult involved should feel free to clarify or adapt any of the social situations presented, depending on the children’s needs. The adult should also make sure that the answers children give are realistic.</p>

<p><b>How much does it cost?</b><br /> 10 ways is free, with no in-app purchases.
