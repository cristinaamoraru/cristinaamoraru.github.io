								<p>Hi! I'm Cristina Moraru, the creator of Socially Savvy Apps.</p>

								<p>Socially Savvy Apps is a little passion project of mine. Given the difficulty of explaining the complex social world in explicit terms, parents of children and teenagers on the autism spectrum are always on the lookout for resources that help them create a personalised social skills curriculum. I noticed that many of these parents are unaware of the existence of iPad (and iPhone) apps that can help teach social skills.</p>

								<p>If you are one of these parents, the purpose of Socially Savvy Apps is to make you aware of these social skills apps, so that you get all the help you need in explaining the social world to your child or teenager. You can use the apps as they are, or as inspiration for other activities centred on social skills. </p> 

								<p> Socially Savvy Apps <a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWkF51tl8jLU9SxOQDylIMQ>also has a YouTube channel</a>, as linked in the video above. The idea behind it is to 'unbox' the apps before you purchase them, so that you know exactly what you're buying. Making one video does however take at least a full day (usually two), and I noticed the audience's interest in the unboxing is heavily skewed toward a minority of the apps only. All this considered, I will create videos of apps that you specifically request - if you'd like to see an unboxing of any of the apps mentioned on this website, email me at sociallysavvyapps [@] gmail.com with your request. This way you will get more information on the apps that you're interested in, and I can focus my efforts on finding even more apps that you can use with your child or teenager.</p>

								<p> As I will be adding more and more apps to this website, it's a good idea to bookmark the "Social Skills Apps" tab for future easy access. And better yet, <a href = https://www.facebook.com/sociallysavvyapps>like Socially Savvy Apps on Facebook</a> to get notified when new apps are added!</p>

								<p> PS: Purchasing the apps through the links provided on this website may earn Socially Savvy Apps a small commission, at no extra cost to you. If you find Socially Savvy Apps helpful, please consider supporting it in this way. You can also support Socially Savvy Apps by sharing it with someone who could find it useful.
