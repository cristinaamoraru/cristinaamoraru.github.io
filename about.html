  <p>Research shows that children and teenagers on the autism spectrum can be highly motivated by interventions delivered with an iPad.</p>
<p>If you have a child or teenager on the autism spectrum, and you struggle to keep them motivated while explaining social rules and behaviours to them, you could consider iPad apps as a learning support.</p>
<p>Socially Savvy Apps finds and reviews iPad apps that teach social skills to children and adolescents on the autism spectrum, so that you can choose between these apps easily.</p>
