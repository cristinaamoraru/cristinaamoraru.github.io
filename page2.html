									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expressionarcade/id684396188?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Expression Arcade</a> consists of three arcade-style games: Spin It, Chatter, and Face It. The player basically has to tap a button, and is given random prompts in each game. These prompts are either combinations of actions and feelings the player has to enact, or conversation starters the player has to use with a parent, therapist or their peers. Pretend to play a video game while being disappointed, or feel powerful while typing on a computer. The combinations are guaranteed to get some laughs. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expressionarcade/id684396188?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Expression Arcade</a> is simple, but the random generation of activities keeps the games interesting. </p>

									<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sobe-stories/id1045707211?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website" class="image fit"><img src="images/sobestories.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sobe-stories/id1045707211?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Social Behavioral Stories</a> was developed to teach children prosocial skills, as well as appropriate behaviours in a school environment. After you tap the play button on the intro screen, you are prompted to choose one of two play modes: Play It or Read It. Play It presents 4 short social scenarios, on the topics of being safe, being helpful, being kind and being responsible. Each scenario prompts the player to choose between two behaviours, one prosocial, the other not so much, and shows the consequence of each choice. Read It contains 5 longer social stories. While reading these stories, the child again gets to make choices, but this time in a ‘choose your own adventure’ format. If the player makes a wrong choice, they see the consequences of their actions. For the choices that are important for the story, after the child sees the consequences, the main character comments on what happened and nudges the child into making a better choice. For the less important choices, the game does not always make it clear when the choices are inappropriate, so ideally an adult should be present to clarify which behaviours are inappropriate and why. The social situations presented are relevant to children’s life experiences, covering themes such as good behaviours in class, playing with others, being nice and kind to others instead of being mean, dealing with others being mean to you, treating your friend’s possessions with respect and waiting for your turn.</p>

									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-allen-adventure/id610042067?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">The Allen Adventure</a> consists of four social stories featuring Allen, an exchange student from Goopitor, who comes to a school on Earth for a week. The stories feature Allen learning how to join a game, how to read facial expressions, what being mean, means, and how to calm himself down. The stories are read aloud by a narrator (you can disable this if you wish) and have interactive features such as tapping to reveal animations in the story panels, making dialogue choices and interactive mini-games. The social situations are relevant for children’s lives, especially when it comes to appropriate behaviour at kindergarten or school. There is a strong focus on how to deal with and prevent bullying. </p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/m66-being-polite/id1032788777?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website" class="image fit"><img src="images/beingpolite.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/m66-being-polite/id1032788777?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Being Polite</a> contains four social stories featuring baby Haha and his friends, Hohohah the monkey, Billy the ant, and Panda the panda. 
									True to the app’s name, the stories revolve around politeness: reacting to someone saying hi to you, helping someone in need, asking for something politely and apologizing when accidentally bumping into someone. Each scenario features three choices the player can make, and only one of them is correct. The choices are indicated by icons, but you are not being told exactly what the icons mean until after the player makes a choice. A narrator explains what goes on in each scenario, with frequent references to how the character’s feelings are affected by what is happening.  When the child makes an incorrect choice, the narrator is quick to say “That is not correct” and explains the consequences of the behaviour selected. Unfortunately, the child doesn’t immediately get to make a better choice. The app simply moves to the next scenario – even after the four scenarios have been played through, the app keeps on looping them until the user clicks on the top right button, which marks the end of the play session. The never-ending loop still allows the child to experiment with all choices, but being able to experiment with a scenario at a time would have been a better approach.
									<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/m66-being-polite/id1032788777?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Being Polite</a> can be played in multiple languages: besides English, you can also choose between Chinese, French and Spanish. </p>

									</header>
									<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/panda-sharing-adventure-babybus/id1003657722?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website" class="image fit"><img src="images/pandasharing.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/panda-sharing-adventure-babybus/id1003657722?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Panda Sharing Adventure</a> teaches children how to share with others. By tapping and dragging items, children share either a cake, toys or snacks between Kiki the Panda, Kitten and Puppy. The children get a sticker for each scenario in which they successfully share, though the app is not very clear on the notion of success. I for one went overboard with feeding Kiki, and though the narrator tried to put me on a better course of action, I persevered… despite Kitten and Puppy’s disappointment, I got a congratulatory animation, and I also got a sticker for sharing! So you might want to play the app with your child and make sure they don’t get the wrong message. In the sharing toys scenario, the child is occasionally prompted to share the toys between the characters. I like how this is portrayed, with everyone getting the chance to play with each toy and having fun while doing so. If your child is not a fan of sharing their toys, this is a good opportunity for you to reframe it in a positive light. The app doesn’t have any parental controls, so pay particular attention to the menu on the app’s home screen, because it can take the child straight to the App Store. Make sure to start the app in Guided Access mode and your child won’t be able to navigate outside it even if they tap on these links.</p>

									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conversation-planner-social-skills-for-asd-kids/id1100862387?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Conversation Planner</a> helps children and teenagers prepare for conversations across a wide array of social situations. Over 130 scenarios are presented in a question and answer format, covering key components of a conversation such as knowing when someone is ready to talk to you, when a conversation should be kept short or when a longer conversation one is appropriate, how to start and end a conversation, and how to react when a conversation does not go the way you expect it to. The player progresses through the conversation components in this order, being allowed to progress only once they master the current skill. As the child masters more conversation components, they access ”Conversation Planner” levels, where they revise everything they learned up to that point. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conversation-planner-social-skills-for-asd-kids/id1100862387?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Conversation Planner</a> can be used either independently, with the child choosing the correct answer out of three alternatives, or with adult support – with the child giving the answer orally and the adult marking it as correct or not. Ideally, an adult should use the app with the child even in the Independent mode, in order to clarify why the child’s answers are correct or not. Each three correct answers earn the player a coin, which they can spend in the app’s “Reward Center”, consisting of two minigames. This gives the player an incentive to learn all conversation components. A nice feature of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conversation-planner-social-skills-for-asd-kids/id1100862387?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Conversation Planner</a> is that you can track your child’s learning, and if they have siblings or friends you’d also like to give the app to, up to 10 player profiles can be created. </p>
