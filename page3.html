This time, Kloog recruits the help of his new human friends to teach social skills to the other aliens in his planetary system. Children learn social skills applicable to both real life and online environments: how to tell if someone is a friend, how to develop and maintain friendships, and how to stay safe from bullies. The lessons are brought to life by gorgeous animations and explanations delivered by Kloog himself. After each lesson, the child gets a quiz testing their newly-gained knowledge. Notably, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kloog-2-return-to-zugopolis-autism-social-skills/id1161731224?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Return to Zugopolis</a> provides children with concrete, actionable steps they can employ in diverse social situations.</p>

Although it is not specifically created for those on the autism spectrum, it is a great tool for creating social stories tailored exactly to the user’s needs and preferences. Creating a new story is easy. You tap +,”Add Story”, give a title to the story, add a cover if you wish, and you’re good to go. Now you only need to add text, drawings, images, audio and/or videos. Your child can flip through the pages manually, or can have the story play automatically. If you wish, you can disable editing, so that they are not able to change the story in any way. </p>

									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-allen-adventure/id610042067?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">The Allen Adventure</a> consists of four social stories featuring Allen, an exchange student from Goopitor, who comes to a school on Earth for a week. The stories feature Allen learning how to join a game, how to read facial expressions, what being mean, means, and how to calm himself down. The stories are read aloud by a narrator (you can disable this if you wish) and have interactive features such as tapping to reveal animations in the story panels, making dialogue choices and interactive mini-games. The social situations are relevant for children’s lives, especially when it comes to appropriate behaviour at kindergarten or school. There is a strong focus on how to deal with and prevent bullying. </p>

									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/m66-being-polite/id1032788777?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Being Polite</a> contains four social stories featuring baby Haha and his friends, Hohohah the monkey, Billy the ant, and Panda the panda. 
									True to the app’s name, the stories revolve around politeness: reacting to someone saying hi to you, helping someone in need, asking for something politely and apologizing when accidentally bumping into someone. Each scenario features three choices the player can make, and only one of them is correct. The choices are indicated by icons, but you are not being told exactly what the icons mean until after the player makes a choice. A narrator explains what goes on in each scenario, with frequent references to how the character’s feelings are affected by what is happening.  When the child makes an incorrect choice, the narrator is quick to say “That is not correct” and explains the consequences of the behaviour selected. Unfortunately, the child doesn’t immediately get to make a better choice. The app simply moves to the next scenario – even after the four scenarios have been played through, the app keeps on looping them until the user clicks on the top right button, which marks the end of the play session. The never-ending loop still allows the child to experiment with all choices, but being able to experiment with a scenario at a time would have been a better approach.
									<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/m66-being-polite/id1032788777?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Being Polite</a> can be played in multiple languages: besides English, you can also choose between Chinese, French and Spanish. </p>
