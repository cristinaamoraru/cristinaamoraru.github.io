									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conversation-planner-social-skills-for-asd-kids/id1100862387?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Conversation Planner</a> helps children and teenagers prepare for conversations across a wide array of social situations. Over 130 scenarios are presented in a question and answer format, covering key components of a conversation such as knowing when someone is ready to talk to you, when a conversation should be kept short or when a longer conversation one is appropriate, how to start and end a conversation, and how to react when a conversation does not go the way you expect it to. The player progresses through the conversation components in this order, being allowed to progress only once they master the current skill. As the child masters more conversation components, they access ”Conversation Planner” levels, where they revise everything they learned up to that point. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conversation-planner-social-skills-for-asd-kids/id1100862387?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Conversation Planner</a> can be used either independently, with the child choosing the correct answer out of three alternatives, or with adult support – with the child giving the answer orally and the adult marking it as correct or not. Ideally, an adult should use the app with the child even in the Independent mode, in order to clarify why the child’s answers are correct or not. Each three correct answers earn the player a coin, which they can spend in the app’s “Reward Center”, consisting of two minigames. This gives the player an incentive to learn all conversation components. A nice feature of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conversation-planner-social-skills-for-asd-kids/id1100862387?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Conversation Planner</a> is that you can track your child’s learning, and if they have siblings or friends you’d also like to give the app to, up to 10 player profiles can be created. </p>

									<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/say-it-or-not-social-filter-skills-school-ed/id1177251535?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Say it... Or Not?</a> helps children learn what is appropriate to say (or not) in over 100 real-life social situations involving family, friends and the wider community, across 12 levels of difficulty. The user needs to demonstrate mastery of each level before progressing to the next one. The app's interface, as well as the strong focus on taking others’ perspective, is very similar to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conversation-planner-social-skills-for-asd-kids/id1100862387?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Conversation Planner</a> from the same developer. The three most important shared features are: game-play mode (independent or with adult support), tracking up to 10 users’ learning, and the Reward Center, which the user can access with coins received for correct responses. The main difference between the apps are the questions and how the levels progress. In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/say-it-or-not-social-filter-skills-school-ed/id1177251535?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Say it... Or Not?</a>, the levels revolve around family, friends, and the wider community. There are three types of questions: inferring other's feelings, determining whether something is ok to say or not, and giving an appropriate response (i.e. something 'ok to say') to a situation.  </p>

Although it is not specifically created for those on the autism spectrum, it is a great tool for creating social stories tailored exactly to the user’s needs and preferences. Creating a new story is easy. You tap +,”Add Story”, give a title to the story, add a cover if you wish, and you’re good to go. Now you only need to add text, drawings, images, audio and/or videos. Your child can flip through the pages manually, or can have the story play automatically. If you wish, you can disable editing, so that they are not able to change the story in any way. </p>
