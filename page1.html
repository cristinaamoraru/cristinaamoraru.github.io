									<p> Socially Savvy Apps finds iPad apps that teach social skills to children and teenagers on the autism spectrum.</p>
									<p>These apps include social stories, social games and even practice with skills such as face expression recognition.</p>
									<p>Research suggests that children and teenagers on the autism spectrum can be highly motivated by interventions delivered with an iPad.</p>
									<p> If you have a child or teenager on the autism spectrum, and you struggle to keep them motivated while explaining social rules and behaviours to them, you could consider iPad apps as a learning support.</p>
									<p> Socially Savvy Apps brings all these apps to one place, so that you can easily find the right ones for your child or teenager.</p>

									<p><a href = https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breathe-think-do-with-sesame/id721853597?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website>Breathe, Think, Do</a> from Sesame Street teaches children how to deal with life’s challenges by managing their emotions and developing plans to solve these challenges. Children help the monster manage his emotions (frustration, sadness, disappointment, being impatient and anxiety) and then come up with and choose a solution for the five challenges he encounters: not being able to tie his shoes, not wanting to say goodbye to mommy at school, dealing with the fall of a tall block tower he built, waiting in line to go down the slide and getting ready to turn off the lights for bedtime. For each challenge, the monster uses a belly-breathing technique to calm down (breathe), after which he makes three plans for coping with the challenge (think). Then the child chooses one of these plans to implement (do). Don’t skip the parents section of the app, it has excellent content! What stand out in particular are the tips and strategies for helping children be persistent, cope with separation, practice patience, overcome mistakes, build confidence and communication skills, be independent, express their emotions in positive ways without resorting to mean or aggressive behaviour, deal with sibling rivalry and adjusting to a move. There is also a ‘breathe with the monster’ animation that your child can practice with, as well as the option to personalise the app with your own (or your child’s voice) instead of the narrator’s. <a href = https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/breathe-think-do-with-sesame/id721853597?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website>Breathe, Think, Do</a> can be used in two languages: either English or Spanish.</p>

									<p>In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-social-express-ii/id886896435?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">The Social Express II</a>, Emma, Zack and their friends embark on a search for the “hidden social keys”. The player follows the children through social scenarios of varied complexity, and gets to choose how the children behave in these situations.  “Video modelling on steroids”, as its developers call it, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-social-express-ii/id886896435?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">The Social Express II</a> is beautifully animated and covers a wide array of social scenarios. The players can see each social scenario in three ways: either as an interactive video, with the player’s choices affecting the outcome, as a normal video which features only the correct choices, and in book form.</p>

Under the coaching of an adult, children compete against one another by answering questions and completing tasks related to social situations and social communication. Despite its competitive format, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/10-ways-a-social-skills-game/id1116372204?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">10 Ways</a> strongly encourages cooperation and group work. There are direct prompts, in the form of questions that require the child to get help from another player. The most notable feature of this app is the open-ended nature of most questions, and their potential to spark debates between participating children and adults. </p>

									<p>By using the story of Kloog, an extraterrestrial that finds himself stranded on Earth, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/social-skills-for-autism/id971311339?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Social Skills for Autism</a> teaches social rules to children and adolescents on the spectrum. Rather than listing social rules, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/social-skills-for-autism/id971311339?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Social Skills for Autism</a> also takes the time to explain why certain behaviours are more appropriate than others. The player helps Kloog learn social rules via “missions”, each targeting a social skill domain: non-verbal communication, conversation skills and what the developers call “think before you talk”, containing lessons on how to disagree in a nice way, what honesty means, and also why social rules are important. Kloog's adventures continue in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kloog-2-return-to-zugopolis-autism-social-skills/id1161731224?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Return to Zugopolis</a></p>

After reading or being read each story, the user is prompted to answer a series of questions. These questions test the user’s understanding of the terms used in the social story, and of the appropriateness of the behaviours and emotions depicted in it. After answering all the questions, the user is told the story again, and is rewarded with golden stars.</p>

This time, Kloog recruits the help of his new human friends to teach social skills to the other aliens in his planetary system. Children learn social skills applicable to both real life and online environments: how to tell if someone is a friend, how to develop and maintain friendships, and how to stay safe from bullies. The lessons are brought to life by gorgeous animations and explanations delivered by Kloog himself. After each lesson, the child gets a quiz testing their newly-gained knowledge. Notably, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kloog-2-return-to-zugopolis-autism-social-skills/id1161731224?mt=8&at=1010lv7p&ct=website">Return to Zugopolis</a> provides children with concrete, actionable steps they can employ in diverse social situations.</p>
